Go round of what we want to get out of the weekend

### Open space 1

* Campaign Ideas
	* These ideas will be brought forward to discuss during the workshop later in the day:
		* International Marxism
		* Unions
		* Young Homelessness
		* Environment
		* Electoral Reform/Votes at 16
		* Brands and Workers Rights
		* Youth Democracy
		* Consent Education/Sex Ed
		* Arms Fair/Nuclear Disarmement
		*

* Caucuses Musing
	* We can find ways to make caucuses more available, less shoved to one side
	* Specific times in programme when no other programme will happen, and people can run caucuses and other non- structure.
	* However, caucuses may sometimes work better when there is somewhat less structure and not 'given' an allocated time by programme team
	* How can caucuses feed back?
		* Caucuses being able to feed back at the next business event could be useful for long term change
		* Make sure to record feed back
	* Making sure caucuses are working should be a part of the accessibility rep's role
	* Language around caucuses needs to make sure that they aren't seen as 'lesser' programme
	* Making sure people can request certain caucuses before the event
	* Action Events Rep to include mention of caucuses as a thing people can request
	* Action next accessibility rep to review the feedback from this musing and record more feedback from people to improve them.


* Woodcraft Folk Name Change Musing
	* History remembered in names
	* Cost of changing name would be large
	* Name doesn't say what we're about, but we redefine the word by our presence.
	* Should DFs change our name first?
	* Most of conversation seemed to be against proposing a name change
	* Philosophical discussion of "What is a name?" and does the name define us or do we define the name??!!
	* A name change could be a minor one, such as "The Woodcraft Folk ________(Insert appropriate word here)"
	* Current name is possibly misleading and requires more of an explanation of what we are?
	* "Brownies, they're not food. They're children."  {Oliver Howard, 2018}
	* "Woodcraft" links with our heritage and doing things with nature is still something that our movement is involved with
	* The strange name can be a good conversation starter which allows us to clarify what it actually is that we do.
	* Big organisations aren't well known because of their name, they're known because of their donors and large memberships.
	* People might be turned away from thinking that woodwork isn't for them
	* To anyone who does know what the name is, 'Woodcraft' becomes that
	* Rebranding and changing perception can be changed in ways other than name changes
	* ACTION: Comms Rep - write a press pack which introduces to people good ways of introducing Woodcraft Folk in ways that aren't clunky and are engaging talk to Debs re. discussions had at development conference
	* ACTION: GC Reps - try to make it more a priority on GC to advertise in new ways that focus on making a consistent branding,

* MEST-UP Policy Musing
	* We're surprised that a MEST-UP policy doesn't exist already.
	* A lot of MEST-UP practise gets passed down in oral/aural(hmm) tradition
	* We need a better defined remit of what MEST-UP does!
	* We need to properly nail down information sharing, and people being aware of what happens in debrief, what information of theirs can be shared, and what choices people have over their data ##GDPR
	* Make a full edition and an abridged edition
	* people gotta know their rights and shit
	* If there is a list kept of MESTUP reps on event, when someone is saying what they want of theirs to be discussed at debrief, they can read through the list and choose who they want in the know
	* We need to have a clear distinction of things which HAVE to go to debrief, can't always just be based on what the people involved want because of safeguarding both the person, and the MEST-UP reps.
	* ACTION: MEST-UP, get as much training in the coming year as we possibly can, probably from external organisations as well. Talk to Debs.
	* ACTION: Ash to put MESTUP at Common Ground and VCamp on the next Thing agenda
	* ACTION: Row, Noah, Brynn, and Debs have a meeting at some point in the next few months
	* ACTION: Ash, write and bring a draft of MEST-UP policy to stuff

### Campaign

Narrow down to four ideas:

* Electoral Reform/Youth Democracy/Votes at 16
	* more likely for everyone to haev opinions on, we do a lot with it so can tie directly in and we have experience with it as a suject
	* we have some 'ins' with influencial political figuvres- DFQT
	* AtoZ of good discussion
	* we can run sessions on this very easily
	* campaigns rep to work with affiliations so that we can work with other campaigns with a similar vein
	* Working with other young groups that can encorporate expanding youth democracy
	* We have to look carefully at which organisations we invite, one has already been not invited to Common Ground
	* how do we go about getting votes at 16?
	* What reforms do we actually want?
	* whats the main outcome of the idea?
	* Empowering youth in democracy is a main theme

* Young Homelessness
	* very local issue and it's easy to get involved at a district level
	* Doing a sleep out - something we'd be well suited to doing
	* Something within our cababilities - doesn't have to require a large govermential change
	* Easy to get other age groups involved
	* has a tangeable outcome
	* How many of us know someone that is affected by youth homeless?
	* we need to have a concrete outcome, not just a generic theme for an aimless campaign
	* other campaigns can also be done at a local level - this issue is not alone in that
	* we can improve the quality of life for these homeless people
	* affiliations would be able to work on this with other organisations as well
* Consent Education/Sex Ed
	* easy to do on a local level and a wider level at the same time
	* greater prominence of trans people in the public eye and we would be able to have discussions about trans people and sex with have yet to be looked at very much
	* we have a lot of resorces and a lot we could do but there could be a lot of barriers as well in terms of schools letting us teach their students
	* maybe talking to other youth groups would be better
	* we can do this very politically, more so that other groups can or would
	* important to youth people and therfore accessible to our age group
	* start at home or rather at your place of employment or education
	* good to take to generic and mainstream populations rather than similar organisations or niche interest groups
	* getting involved in the national conversations
	* producing some guides or advice about how to teach sex Ed
	* first year could be training and planning and then next year going into uni freshers fairs
	* come from a good point rather than a scare tactic or a praise tactic we can be more balanced

* Big Corporations(Brands), Workers Rights, and Unions
	* everyone will proably be in a position to join a union at some point in life
	* unions are dead key for having more youth engagement and resorces
	* central wcf is already affiliated we can do lots with them
	* dfs tried to run a join a union week we could do that agian
	* we can do helping with strikes for lots of unions
	* unions like to give young people money
	* look outwards so help other people to join union
	* we can teach ourself a lot about unions
	* very tangencial outcome for DFs


### Open Space 2

* Standing against Someone in the middle of their term
	* Similar to a VNC
	* allows Althing to decide rather than DF Committee - More democratic
	* increases accoutability as they know they could be replaced at Althing
	* If someone is not good enough in their first year then that outweighs the negatives of replacing them
	* if no one stands then the incumbant remains
	* if R.O..N win is that effectivly a Vote of No Comfidence and woud the person be removed from ctte?
	* ACTION: Secretary to add this to AOB


* Food Policy
	* It's a very delicate balance between the KP wellbeing and pressure, the environmental issues, and people getting food that they like
	* How much should we care about people not liking certain food?
	* Food can be detramental to people even if it's not an alergie or an intororance
	* Several people said that they couldn't always eat the food at events
	* people should be told at the start of the day what that days meals are
	* People need to be asked in more detail what their relationship with that food is - dislike, can't eat, allgery, etc
	* making two sets of a meal can sometimes provide a work around
	* People should be told more that they can make their own food in the kitchen tent if they don't like the food that is provided
	* bland food also makes events inaccessible
	* if we know more how people feel about food we're more able to decide who is responsible for aliviating that tension
	* Keep foods seperate as much as possible!!
	* Trying to reduce food miles is an imprtant issue - should there be more consultation with the sustainability rep - though this is in the poilicy atm
	* Check list of nessisary things like tea towels but also things like don't buy israli goods and try to reduce food miles
	* ACTION: Robin to update the Events Pack including with info about food at events
* Fundraising
	* Apply for grants
	* merch, push to sell, Badges, stickers and smaller items more successful. Sell externally, wider woodcraft and outside Woodcraft
	* workersbeer
	* consultation work from woodcraft/DF
	* Personal donations, friends of the folk
	* local fundraising, make sure events that are run are inclusive for all ages and family fun. School fates
	* Run DF care centre at local primary schools
* Safe guarding
	* Split role format: motion passed last year saying safeguarding role cannot be split because of confidentiallity issues, conflict of interest, 2 yr turnover hard for a handover of responsibility
	* Shadow format: one person would have less responsibility
	* laymember format: less stress for chair and vice chair. Doesn't always ensure that there will be an overlap. Gives equal responsibility

### Motions
#### Motion 1
* Df can capitalise from the boom that is love island by nominating and electing 2 DF memebers to the next seasson of love island. Motion is spoken against so discussion continues.
* *Amendment* proposed that we should chage the show "love island" to "the great british bake off"
	* much wider reach than love island
	* the best judges have gone
	* Bake off may reach wider audience but love island is our target audience (young people)
	* 6 for, 10 against, 5 abstentions, amendment falls
* Contestants in love island are put under stress and emotional trama, do we really want to send DFs to have this kind of stress?
* LGBT representaion on love island, we'd be perfect to do this
* *Amendment*, a significant contribution of the winnings are donated to DFs, Amendment is passed
* Only 18+ DFs can be sent but still includes younger demographoic in the audience
* Make sure that those who apply are people who want to apply.
* 10 for, 5 against, 6 absentions, motion passes

#### Motion 3

* Two members of DF committee elected at old/new to be part of GC. However old/new often happens after the first GC meeting.
* When roles are advertised make sure it is clear that members can also stand to be on GC
* 20 for , 0 against, 2 abstentions, motion passes

#### Motion 4

* Members are expensed for the price of business events, but the democratic procedures don't reflect this. We should update our documents to reflect what we already practice.
* No one spoke against, the motion passes

#### Motion 5

* Current practice is that you can second your own motion and that it 'should' be seconded. Motions don't need to be seconded, this motion will ensure that future motions don't have to be seconded but you cannot second your own motion.
* No one spoke against it motion passed

#### Motion 6

* There is no reason for the role of sustainability to be on committee, it should be a non committee role.
* No one spoke against the motion is passed

#### Motion 7

* There was an issue with contactibility of the events rep on DF camp this year and caused an issue between younger DFs and parents. It should be a requirement that for the entirety of the whole event there is a number the can be contacted that is checked twice a day
* At the event we would figure out who can take reponsibility for this as the event depending on who has signal
* *Amendment* proposed to add "where possible" to the checks. Amendment passes
* *Amendment* To remove "where possible" from place previously added
	* Problems because it is important that parents can have contact with younger members.
	* Saying that a member is contactable 2 times a day and the not being contactable is more of a scare than suggesting that a member may not be contactable
	* Info pack says to parents that we will try our best to be contactable but it's not always possible
	* Having a guarentee that a member will always be contacable is difficult
	* *Action* robin and oliver to research ways that we are always contactable on events
	* It has happened that ther is no signal on camp so it shouldnt be a guarentee
	* For 16, against 2, Abstentions 2
*  *Amendment* that events should check signal at events and notify members via the info pack. This amendment is to ensure that parents are less worried about their children. 19 for, 1 against, 3 absentions, motion is amended.
*  *Amendment* to change "these is a contactable  phone number and email adress" to "ponit of contact". Passed
*  *Amendment* To say "definatly checked daily, twice daily where possible". Accepted
*  *Proposal* we agree with the basis of the motion and we should move to vote.
*  Make sure that parents of 16/17 year olds are aware that this is a check not an all the time contactable number.
*  *Action* events rep to write the outcome of this motion into the events pack.
*  The motion as amended has passed, no one spoke against motion

#### Motion 2

* Removed workers beer with their dutieds absorbed by fundraising. This role only has significance in the summer so is a dud role for the rest of the year. Would also give the fundraising rep more of a 'main role' that they have for the year. No one spoke against, Motion passes

#### Motion 8

* Make sure that members who are standing for vetoable roles do not stand for a role they have already been vetoed for.
* Annonanymity is important to the veto and should be respected.
* Just becuse you have been vetoed once doesn't mean you can't run again and wont be re-elected for another year.
* If you've been vetoed then there is a reason that you have been vetoed. Just because that person that vetoed you is not present, doesn't mean tht the veto no longer valid.
* Members could guess who vetoed them and why, adds prssure to mebers who have resons to veto but wish to remain annonymus
* As a movment we should take reponsiblility for these issues.
* *Action* Next Thing bringup the point of collective repoinisbility and vetos as a whole.
* 0 for, 15 against, 7 abstentions

#### Motion 9

* Someone in an elected possion is given a vote of no confidence, there is currently no requirement that there is reasoning behind the proposal. Makes it hard for members who have been voted out to change and slows committee discusion. This motion says that there must be a formal written reason as to why a member is being vote on.
* *Amendment* The rational for veto is first read and reworded by the member dealing with the vote of no confidence before being given to the member being voted on. Accepted.
* No one spoke against, Motion passed

###Late Motions
####Late Motion 1

* There are currently no DF fire safty policies, this would be a requirement for all other movments. Like the consent policy and intoxication substances policy, DF feel it is important to have a similar document in referance to fire safty.
* *Amendment* Add as a starting suggestion to second bullet point, Accepted
* *Amendment* Add another bullet point to make sure that policy is taken into consideration by the KE, evening programe and risk assessor
* *Action* Events rep to include information on risk assesments

* *Action* events rep to add "non-biodegradable glitter" to the do not bring section of the kit list.
* *Amendment* clarify that craft glitter is allowed. Rejected.
* Glitter is great but non-biodgradable glitter also uses many resorces so we should not allow any glitter on events at all.
