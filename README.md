# DF-Things

Welcome to the DF Things repository, this is where we store all of the democratic documents for Dfs, these include the agenda and minutes of things, The governing documents of DFs and any Policies that are currently in place.

This is being maintained by the secretary who will try to keep these as up to date as possible, hope you enjoy looking around, the archived section of the repository includes items that are over a year old but are under 10 years old when they can be deleted.

If you need to contact the secretary for any reason please use secretary@spanthatworld.com
