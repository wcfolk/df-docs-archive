\section{Motions}
Eight motions were carried over to Old/New from Althing as there wasn't time to discuss them.
\subsection{Motion 29: Food hygiene (passed)}
This DF althing recognises the importance of food hygiene at DF events and that while all foods should be stored and prepared in a safe and clean environment, some foods require different or more demanding care.

This DF Althing therefore resolves to:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Action the Events rep to add a section on food hygiene in the Events pack.
	\item Advise KPs to never use ingredients they are: not comfortable with, inexperienced with or do not have the facilities to store properly.
	\item Reaffirm the KP's responsibility to keeping all food preparation and storage areas clean and functional.
\end{itemize*}

No rationale given.

Proposed by Issy Coleman.

Motion passes 16-0 (4 abstentions).

\subsection{Motion 33: Legal drugs (passed as amended)}
This Althing would like to recognise that legal drugs can be just as harmful to one's health, sometimes more so, than illegal drugs. Therefore the DF Movement discourages the use of any drug if the user is not absolutely happy in their knowledge of:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item Its contents
	\item What effects it can have
	\item The quantities in which it is safe to consume.
\end{enumerate*}

Rationale: Legal highs can be worse health-wise if you end up in hospital. Staff see lots of overdoses in most illegal drugs, and thus know what chemicals are involved and the best treatments.

Proposed by Ellie Ferguson.

Motion as amended passes unopposed.

\subsubsection{Amendment (accepted)}
Summary to be included in Drugs and Alcohol policy to be read out at events.

Proposed by Joe MacMahon (Kess).

Amendment accepted by proposer.

\subsection{Motion 35: Membership fees (passed)}
This DF Althing instructs the Events Rep, Secretary and Chair to ensure that every person attending a DF event has paid membership fees and every one that needs it has an up to date CRB.

In order to do this we suggest they:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item The week before an event they send all the names of those booked to someone with access to the membership database and ask them to check those people.
	\item Tell anybody that isn't a member that they will be turned away if they don't pay for and fill in a form for membership on camp. On the event, chase up those that book in the last week.
\end{enumerate*}

No rationale given.

Proposed by Laurie Canell.

Motion passes 18-0 (3 abstentions)

\subsubsection{Amendment (withdrawn)}
Look into creating a policy about lying on booking forms.

Proposed by Saskia Neibig.

Amendment rejected by proposer and withdrawn.

\subsection{Motion 38: Gift Aid (passed as amended)}
This Althing [demands] that the Events Rep and Treasurer provide the option to gift aid donations of event costs. [*]

No rationale given.

Proposed by Joe F. Bowler (Jay).

Motion as amended passes unopposed.

\subsubsection{Amendment 1 (accepted)}
Replace ``demands'' with ``strongly recommends''.

Proposed by Joe MacMahon (Kess).

Accepted by proposer.

\subsubsection{Amendment 2 (accepted)}
Append ``And explain to people how gift aid works.''

Proposed by Jess Poyner.

Accepted by proposer.

\subsection{Motion 39: Committee quarterly reports (passed as amended)}
This Althing reaffirms the demand that all members of Committee provide 1/4ly update reports even if they do not attend Things. This is already in the Constitution. [*]

No rationale given.

Proposed by Joe F. Bowler (Jay).

Motion as amended passes unopposed.

\subsubsection{Amendment (accepted)}
Append ``*raised eyebrows*''.

Proposed by Ruori McIntyre.

Accepted by proposer.

\subsection{Motion 42: Event Mentors (passed as amended)}
This DF Althing instructs that when DFs are part of a coordination team for the first time they should have a `Mentor' that they can contact for advice and help before and at the event.

The mentors would either be experienced DFs or Kinsfolk -- preferably someone attending the event but at least contactable by phone.

Rationale: This would help organisation, cooperation of coordination team, menu planning and the general smooth running of future events.

Proposed by Issy Coleman.

Motion as amended passes unopposed.

Note from Verity: Would be good to have mentors trained centrally by Woodcraft -- there is a mentoring training weekend next weekend. Also there are mentors available from central Woodcraft already.

\subsubsection{Amendment (passed)}
Potential mentees should be given the option to have a mentor or not.

Proposed by Louise Delmége.

Amendment passes unopposed.

\subsection{Motion 44 (withdrawn)}
Not to be discussed as previous motion passed.

\subsection{Motion 53 (amended, tabled)}
This Althing instructs the Treasurer to seek to fund Woodcraft's mission through our investments. We aim to fund companies with similar values of peace, co-operation and education for social change.

We aim to withdraw investment from companies profiting from the arms trade, exploitation, human rights abuse and climate change.

[*] This Althing instructs the Treasurer to take reasonable steps to move DF funds to an ethical bank such as Triodos. If this is not practical for all of the funds, it should be attempted for an appropriate amount, such as the majority.

Proposed by (we think) Sam Sender.

Motion as amended tabled.

\subsubsection{Amendment (passed)}
Prepend final paragraph with ``Therefore''. Capitalise accordingly.

Proposed by Emma Jagne.

Amendment passes unopposed.

\subsubsection{Proposal}
Tablue until next Althing because of current Treasurer issues.

Proposed by Samir Rana.

Proposal passes 15-1 (2 abstentions).

\subsection{Remaining motions}
At Althing, some un-discussed motions were also sent to ``a social event'', and ``a Thing'', to be decided by Old/New.

Social event: Winter Wonderland (unanimous).

Thing: North East Thing (unopposed).

\section{Internal Elections}
Note: The positions elected in internal elections are also shown in Tables \ref{tab:ctte} and \ref{tab:council}
\subsection{Regional Council}
Emma Jagne elected as Chair.

Samir Rana elected as Vice Chair.

Leonor Worssam elected as General Council Rep.

\subsection{DF Committee}
Saskia Neibig elected as Staff Liaison.

Emily Connor elected as Sustainability

Louise Delmége elected as General Council Rep.

Saskia Neibig elected as Vice Chair.

Jess Poyner elected as Last Bastion of Hope (Chair).

\section{Treasurer/Finance discussion (DF Committee)}
It was discussed what to do about the lack-of-Treasurer situation. Committee have the option of co-opting somebody to the role of Treasurer with a 2/3rds majority, or otherwise management of finances falls to General Secretary, Chair and Treasurer of central Woodcraft.

One candidate was nominated for co-opting, but we decided to let responsibility fall to central Woodcraft.

\subsection{Logistics}
At this point, it was assumed that the General Secretary, Chair of GC and Treasurer would find somebody and delegate to them the task of managing our finances. We require the following of them:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item That they aim to carry through financial decisions made at Althing.
	\item That they make payments within 3 months.
	\item To maintain a minimum of £20,000 in the DF bank account.
	\item To have DF Committee approve budgets, asking for the input of the central Woodcraft Treasurer.
	\item That they make arrangements for the training of the Shadow Treasurer, be that training them themselves or finding somebody else to train them.
	\item That they attend DF Things or send apologies.
\end{itemize*}

As soon as Ellie M is a signatory, she should organise Fairer Fare and expenses as this isn't too difficult. Saul should do Althing and Old/New expenses for the time being.

The process of finding a Treasurer should be completed sufficiently quickly to avoid any potential financial problems with paying for Winter Wonderland.

Richard Lace was suggested as a potential candidate to recommend.

The following people should be signatories on the bank account: Treasurer, Shadow Treasurer, Chair, Secretary, Events, Fundraiser.

Saul has written up four alternatives for next year's budget, these are to be passed on to the new Treasurer.

\section{Dates}
\subsection{Spring Awakening}
This is always difficult to place, as you have to avoid the Scottish school term, Easter, and Passover. Usually we have to place it during the Scottish term or during Passover, alternating from year to year, but this year the dates are conveniently aligned:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Must begin exclusively after Friday, March 29th (English/Welsh school term).
	\item Must end exclusively before Monday, April 8th (Scottish school term).
	\item Must avoid Passover (sunset of Monday, March 25th--nightfall Tuesday, April 2nd).
	\item Must avoid Easter (Sunday, March 31st).
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{DF Camp}
There was some discussion about this, as it seemed impossible to fit in the calendar given Venturer Camp dates, and term dates of England/Wales and Scotland.
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Must begin exclusively after Friday, 26th July (English/Welsh school term).
	\item Must end exclusively before Monday, 12th August (Scottish school term).
	\item Must avoid Venturer Camp (Saturday, 3rd--Sunday, 11th August)
	\item Preferably avoid Venturer Camp Working Week (Thursday, 1st--Saturday, 3rd August)
\end{itemize*}
It was decided to put it a couple of days into the English school term, as we decided that the only people of DF age this would inconvenience would be a small number of Year 12 students.
