Motions and Musings for Althing 2018
=================================================

Foreword
--------

The motions listed here are not necessarily in the order they will be in on the final agenda.  The deadline for early submission has passed, and as such if any new motions or musings are received they will be discussed only if there is sufficient time available.

Motions
-------

### Motion 1 (Love Island) ###

This Althing notes that Love Island is one of TV and pop culture's greatest current phenomena.
This Althing also notes the barriers to general cultural awareness of the DF Movement.
Therefore, this Althing instructs the secretary to ensure the selection, at this Althing by election if possible considering timekeeping, of two DFs to apply to the next series of Love Island.

#### Rationale ####

The people selected to be applicants will be able to get the movement more mainstream recognition, and slightly further radicalise the TV show 'Love Island,' if they manage to get onto the show.

(Proposed by Ash Taylor)

(Seconded by Zeph Deakin)

### Motion 2 (Workers' Beer Representative) ###

This Althing removes the Workers' Beer Representative from the set of Non-Committee roles, with their duties absorbed by the Fundraising Representative.

The constitution will be amended as follows:

* Remove *"Workers' Beer Representative"* from section **B.3.2.2**

#### Rationale ####

This role should be done by the fundraising rep to give it some accountability.

(Proposed by Sophie Holden)

### Motion 3 (Electing DF Committee's representatives to General Council) ###

This Althing notes that General Council’s residential meeting that takes place in Autumn is critical for a new member of General Council. Therefore, this Althing resolves to allow DF Committee to elect their General Council representatives between Althing and Old/New, allowing them to attend the residential meeting in the case of Old/New taking place afterwards.

The constitution will be amended as follows:

* Append **B.4.2.2** with *“This may exclude the General Council representatives who can be elected between Althing and Old/New.”*

* Section **B.4.2.2** will now read as follows: *“The business of Old/New will include the election of secondary roles (see B.1.3.2). This may exclude the General Council representatives who can be elected between Althing and Old/New.”*

#### Rationale ####

Scheduling conflicts can mean it is difficult to ensure that Old/New happens before the first General Council meeting. This motion would guarantee DF Committee's representatives to GC have the ability to attend a very important and helpful meeting regardless of when Old/New happens.

(Proposed by Lara Taylor)

(Seconded by Ash Taylor)

### Motion 4 (Expensed Places Event Payment) ###

This Althing notes that current practise has been to allow those with expensed places to be exempt from paying for the business event they are expensed to.

This Althing also notes that the Democratic Procedures document states that those with expensed places may claim, 'Travel Expenses' but does not reference the requirement to pay for the event itself.

Therefore, this Althing amends the Democratic Procedures as follows:

* Append: *"and may be exempt from having to pay the full event cost"* to the first sentence of sections **2.3.1** and **2.3.2** of the Democratic Procedures."

#### Rationale ####

It is important to update our documents to reflect current practises.

(Proposed and Seconded by Ash Taylor)

### Motion 5 (Seconding of Motions) ###

This Althing amends the democratic procedures, such that the body seconding a motion at Althing must be different from the body proposing it.

The Althing also removes the implication that a motion being seconded is expected.

The Democratic Procedures shall be amended as follows:

* In Section 3.1, change the word *'should'* to *'may,'* and change the words *'does not have to'* to *'must.'*

#### Rationale ####

A discussion at DF camp about the process of motions led to a group of people realising how confusing the wording around seconding is and have agreed this change could help clear that up.

(Proposed by Lucy Wade)

(Seconded by Alfie Burgh)

### Motion 6 (Sustainability Rep) ###

This Althing changes the role of Sustainability from a Secondary DF Committee Role to a Non-Committee role.

The Constitution will be amended as follows:

* Remove *"Sustainability Representative"* from section **B.1.3.2.3 (*The Secondary roles shall be the following*)**

* Add *"Sustainability Representative"* to section **B.3.2.2**

#### Rationale ####

There is very little reason that the sustainability representative needs prior access to DF Committee. They will still be able to have access to talk to all members of DF Committee through email, in particular the events rep and by extension, events teams.

Making it a non-committee role rather than a secondary role will ensure that there will be a greater range of people to choose from, including those who may be more suitable for the role than the small number of people on DF Committee.

(Proposed by Ash Taylor)

### Motion 7 (Events Contact) ###

This Althing instructs the Events Rep to ensure that for the entire duration of every event, business or social, there is a contactable phone number and email address to be checked twice daily on the event, ensuring all queries and issues get prompt responses.

#### Rationale ####

Although this is likely already a policy, it has not been in practice on the last two events (soz guys, a tad my fault). At DF camp, a parent tried to contact us concerning the safe return of a DF from the site, and received absolutely no response from anybody until I received the texts and emails after the camp had ended. This concerns me as it (on top of the clear safety issue for people in need of assistance) reduces our credibility as an organisation.

(Proposed by Robin Lyster)

### Motion 8 (Veto) ###

This Althing changes the veto such that any party that was vetoed for a role will be informed that the veto took place. Only that party would know that the veto took place, and this detail shouldn’t be revealed to the wider movement.

#### Rationale ####

By being told that you had been vetoed for a role you have a better understanding of whether you should be standing for a role and an insight into the reasons that the veto took place.

(Proposed by Joel Cockerill-Evans)

### Motion 9 (Vote of No Confidence Reasonings) ###

This Althing creates a requirement that the proposer of a Vote of No Confidence, in either Committee or Non-Committee roles, must submit a formal statement of reasoning, to be sent to the person being voted on and DF Committee, alongside their call for the vote.

The Constitution shall be amended as follows:

* Append section **B.1.5.2.1** of the constitution with: *"Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence in a committee role must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the committee role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and the other members of committee when they are informed about the call."*

* Append section **B.3.5.2.1** of the constitution with: *"Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and DF Committee when they are informed about the call."*

* Section **B.1.5.2.1** of the constitution will now read: *"Any DF may call a vote of no confidence on a role on committee; this vote will be taken by Committee (excluding the member in question) and will require an 2/3rds majority vote to pass. Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence in a committee role must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the committee role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and the other members of committee when they are informed about the call."*

* Section **B.3.5.2.1** of the constitution will now read: *"Any DF may call a vote of no confidence on any Non-Committee role; this vote will be taken by Committee and will require an 2/3rds majority vote to pass. Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and DF Committee when they are informed about the call."*

#### Rationale ####

When someone has a Vote of No Confidence called in them, it will often be called by someone who wishes to remain anonymous. This gives the person subject to the vote very little chance to build a case in their favour, as they don't know who, and from what capacity, sent it, and they also don't know why it has been called. This means that they have very little to work on to convince DF Committee that the issues that have been seen in them can be resolved.

(Proposed by Ash Taylor)

Musings
-------

A musing consists of a thought or a question, formulated to inspire creative discussion. A musing is
less formal than a motion, and are discussed in the ‘open space’ system. Musings have an open result; that is to say the actions to come out of a musing are not predefined. It may be the case that a motion is formulated and proposed as a result of a musing, but equally a working group may be set up, or a project started by interested parties.

### Musing Alfa (Woodcraft Folk Name Change) ###

I strongly feel that one of the reasons it is so hard to recruit new members is because of the name Woodcraft Folk. Although I understand the sentimental value of the name it is very silly to have a name that is not simply an ambiguous name that needs explaining but literally means something that we are not (people who make things out of wood). I also think the name is slightly embarrassing to try and get a more diverse group of people in. We spoke recently about doing uni fairs and there is no way I would ever set up a stall asking my peers to come learn about the woodcraft folk and if I did I would attract the same hemp wearing middle class that we are trying to diversify away from. I do not have an alternative and I do not think it will pass in 2019 but I think it is really important to start this conversation if we are going to keep woodcraft modern and attract more and new people.

(Aggie Taylor - Treasurer)

### Musing Bravo (Food on Events) ###
It's been a year since we initiated our [food policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r45kNGZH-K4z2Nv_OieXemZLgcTCE36ey0EQ0C2hDPk/edit?usp=sharing) and this is a discussion about how it's gone. How sustainable are we being? How is the way we handle food impacting KPs, coordinators, and clans? And how is food affecting the way that people enjoy, and decide to come to, events? This musing will give you the opportunity to come up with meaningful change for the future through motion-writing, and allow you to have a think about changes you might want to make to the policy.

(Multiple parties)

### Musing Charlie (Caucuses) ###
Feedback from the BME caucus at DF camp/the fishbowl seemed to be a potentially useful starting point for some positive changes in DFs, however many other caucuses were cut short or pushed to the end of the program, and weren’t able to give feedback to the wider group. Therefore it seems that this might be something that needs to be highlighted more at future events so that caucuses can be as useful and positive as possible for the movement. More could be done to make caucuses an important and productive part of program, especially with regards to the wider group hearing feedback from them. Perhaps this could be done at events, or perhaps each caucus might try to send a representative to feedback at an upcoming business event? Maybe we could even consider making an individual person (secondary committee role?) responsible for ensuring caucuses happen on at least a large number of events and feedback from them is heard?

(Rose Pitman-Wallace)

### Musing Delta (Number of People Holding Safeguarding) ###
There's a restriction that the role of safeguarding can only be held by one person at a time. Should this be changed, either to allow two people to hold the role, or to make it mandatory that there are two safeguarding representatives. Because safeguarding is often a personal matter in DFs, it could be useful to split the role between two people so it is less likely to have a conflict of interest. It could also stop putting as much pressure on other ctte members who are often already stretched. This might however put more strain on DF finances and could mean that there are more breaches of confidentiality.

(Brynn Alred - Safeguarding Rep)

### Musing Echo (What do we want from the MEST-UP policy?) ###
There is going to be a new policy in town: The MEST-UP policy! This will give us a chance to solidify the way that MEST-UP operates as a group on events. Come to this musing to discuss what you think should be in the policy before it begins being drafted over the next few months.

(Ash Taylor - Secretary)

### Musing Foxtrot (Fundraising) ###
A brainstorming session to discuss all the ways that DFs could raise funds.

(Amber Sims - Accessibility Rep)
