  * Someone was asked whether the list of roles and definitions could be put on the website
    * Currently that isn't possible as the website password isn't there

#### Transparency of the inner movements of Dfs
  * Currently the groups like mest-up and committee aren't transparent and the website has little to no information
  * Mini things are a way of increasing Transparency but aren't not hugely helpful
  * posts on how we are working currently and releasing tools
  * Mest-up has reduced the number of workshops and that is having an impact on Transparency
  * **Proposal**
    * Bi-weekly reports are being produced by committee and could be put on the website (website is currently not accessible by web fairy)
  * Workshops don't reach everyone and are may not be of interest to people until an issue occurs and we should be more transparent when that happens.
  * Rules of Mest-up Discussions and debrief aren't well communicated
  * Remaking the rough guide to Dfs is happening
  * The information is said before in mest-up chats but debrief is still mystified
  * **Proposal**
    * rough guide to debrief
  * While we've been told about what it is, we still don't know a huge amount about what happens in debrief because it is behind closed doors
  * Could an individual ask about what happened with a personal issues
  * Only Mest-up understand why it's important and while people can trust that it is important but it can be patronising as the team largely states that "everything is ok" which doesn't explain why it's important or why they can't say anything.
  * **Action Programme DF Camp & Mest-up Coordinators - Followed up by Robin (Events Rep)**
    * Fake debrief fishbowl at Df Camp + Mest-up Q&A
      * Film it and put it on the website
  * Having a list of the mest-up reps on the event that can be used to inform someone of the people who can be at debrief.

#### "The Erasmus Situation"
  * In 2016 we were contacted about running a pride camp with the Austrian falcon movement, Erasmus gave us £8000 and we didn't deliver on the event
    * £4000 was given to the Austrians
  * The Money was largely spent on accommodation and flights
  * There was a lack of communication and Dfs as well as woodcraft weren't aware of the situation and what was meant to happen
  * It fell through because there wasn't enough advertising and so there weren't enough UK participants and so the event couldn't go ahead
  * We are unsure whether the Austrians were contacted by Erasmus but we believe so
  * The amount of time we are taking to sort this is normal for a situation like this, especially as it is all through email

#### Events
  * Spring Awakening
    * Based in Notingham
    * Currently all roles are filled but Programme and KP could be helpful to have.
  * DF Camp
    * Based in Exeter
