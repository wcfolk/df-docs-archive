  * **Hand Signals**
  * **First Discussion:  BEAN BASILER**
    * Beans tastes better with basil and so should be considered a hero
      * the sauce has been basiled as well as beans
    * undermines the KPs authority when creating the menu
    * Anonymous confession to basiling beans
      * premeditated basiling
    * Roumoured plot to basil PB
      * Ash is an accessory to basiling
    * Alexi has been suggested to be the basiler
    * We could all be basiling the beans
    * **Action: Chris watches over the basiler**
    * RON could be the bean peanut butter
  * **Campaigns role Discussion**
    * Campaigns role hasn't been filled and so nothing has happened through that
    * Should we keep the Campaigns role
    * Should we keep Campaigns
    * When we change campaign we lose the links with organisations
    * Allows DFs to push for issues that they are passionate about
      * Removes Dfs that aren't passionate about the campaign
    * There are things that are happening that we do but might not be relevant to the campaigns
      * e.g. Yarlswood, March against the Arms Fair
    * Activism could be a role on Committee, Campaigns would be a non-Committee role that a person would run for with a campaign.
    * Campaigns suggest we need to do huge amounts of important actions, but we are better at doing smaller things, and supporting other organisations and events
      * We are better at organising things for the summer and Activism would allow us to that
      * **Action: Izzy and Alexi, go through minutes and create a basis for a motion on changing campaigns**
  * **Mest-UP Policy/Guide**
    * Creating an open Document to add stuff to for Mest-UP
    * **Action: Alexi, create a social media group for writing these things**
      * Row and Noah decide the social media
    * Having non Mest-Up people to be involved
      * Can't see the woods for the trees
  * **DF Camp**
    * Got site
    * Roles Filled:
      * One programme
    * We can give support to people who want to organise events
      * We have rough guides to coordinating roles
    * Looks really good on CV
  * **Venturer Camp**
    * Centres have been decided
      * No LGBT Centre
        * All other centres have to include LGBT stuff
    * 3rd - 10th August
    * Lots of Volunteering
    * Winter Wonderland bookings could be open at V Camp
  * **Increasing Event Prices**
    * It makes sense to Increase prices based on inflation
    * the last events have lost money, but these could be isolated events, especially DF Camp
    * We have been able to run events on this cost before and reallocating budgets could help with the issues
    * We make profit from events and little else and that is needed to cover operating costs, grants are temporary and can't be assured
    * Discussion about prices about being too high at welsh thing, discussion about fairer fare but for events, solidarity fund (vague idea) people could apply to it and get reimbursed for the event cost at least partially to increase inclusivity and Accessibility, would be divvied out evenly
    * Wider woodcraft increasing membership, but the raise would be higher than ours would be (for individual and group membership) (set increase with minimum / median wage increases) idk summat like that
    * The Â£12.00 per year membership would increase with minimum, the normal membership would be increased with the median wage
    * **Temperature check** raising event prices
    * Very mixed bag
    * **Temperature check** Solidarity fund plus more event prices
    * More positive but still lukewarm
    * Worries about inaccessibility but understanding that we need more Money
    * We should look into creating a solidarity fund system, possibly opting in to pay more for the solidarity fund, as well as parents, others in the folk, as they might even say yes
    * Friends of the folk is a system that allows non members who support the folk's values can donate money, why not do this with DFs?
    * If we increase event prices without changing how events are run, there'll be a sharp increase in event prices, as it happened last time. Even the solidarity fund might not be utilized enough to change the fact that some people can't come. Potentially reduce thing budget or decrease number of events before raising event prices. If the event price increases, increase the food allowance
    * The solidarity fund won't be easy to know about, especially to new members, will make it harder to bring new members in
    * Money is difficult, the main thing is inclusivity. But if we can't run without the amount of money we get, then no one can come as we'll be slapped by the invisible hand of the free market into oblivion. Increasing price is the only viable way to do that right now. It's always a problem, people won't like it, but it's necessary.
    * People won't think they're poor enough to apply for the solidarity fund and might feel bad.
  * **Trans Stuff**
    * We need get a team to write it
    * **Tom has volunteered to be an admin for the woodcraft Folk Facebook page**
  * **Other social media presences**
    * We need to use other social media than Facebook
      * Facebook is really good for running Events
        * Doesn't matter if people don't use it
    * Website has issues due to admin stuff
    * Instagram as a front for more detailed information
    * Website is still largely usable
    * Email is good
    * Putting Instagram account on private and inviting people who we know are in Woodcraft
    * Better way to email all DFs
      * Monthly News Letters for DFs
        * **Action: Alfie & Izzy, make a Quarterly News Letter**
          * Wider DFs participation in the Zine
      * General increase in communication
      * Dfs working with their district more
      * make DFs look good to wider woodcraft
