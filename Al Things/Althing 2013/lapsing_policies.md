Althing 2013 Lapsing Policies Motion
====================================

Motions to be repealed
----------------------

This Althing repeals the following policy-making motions.  The reason for repealing is given alongside each motion, unless it is simply that it is no longer current practice.

### From 2008 ###

#### Motion 2 ####
This DF Althing recognizes the difficulty of finding venues for winter wonderland and as such instructs that venues be contacted at least 15 months in advance and be booked at least 15 months in advance.

#### Motion 20 ####
This DF Althing recommends that where possible, Current affairs & controversial issues should be presented to DFs with both sides of the argument (i.e. ‘for’ and ‘against’). All speakers on events should allow time for an extended question and answer session.

#### Motion 29 ####
This DF Althing instructs committee to pay expenses to the following only: All members of DF committee attending Things, Althing and Old New, Regional Developers to the Thing in their region, event organisers to the Thing before their event and all others approved by committee.

##### Reason #####
Policy on expenses is going in the Democratic Procedures document.

#### Emergency Motion G ####
This DF Althing recognises that since last years change to the constitution regional reps have been extremely ineffective and they should therefore be partiall expensed to come to things. This would ensure they actually do things for their regions.  Committee decides a block of money yearly at Old/New.

### From 2009 ###

#### Motion 1 ####
This DF Althing recognizes that many of our procedures at Althing are based on tradition and as such formalizes them thus:
    1. To pass a motion there must be a simple majority of those not abstaining.
    2. To pass a motion changing the constitution there must be a two thirds majority of those present.
    3. If the votes for and against a non-constitutional motion are equal then the motion shall fail to pass.

##### Reason #####
This is now written down in the Democratic Procedures so this policy is unnecessary.

#### Motion 2 ####
This DF Althing institutes the following procedure for tied votes, first the number of first place votes shall be considered, the higher number wining, then second place, and so on, if it remains a tie we will facilitate a revote as quickly and democratically as possible and consult standing orders. This process is to be added to the constitution as appropriate.

##### Reason #####
Same as above.

#### Motion 4 ####
This DF Althing instructs that the cost of all DF events should be affordable to everybody in both an immediate and holistic sense and that funding should be applied for in each case.

#### Motion 9 ####
This DF Althing instructs that each region is to hold an annual social event, and that Regional developers are to ensure this happens (not necessarily organise it). This could be as large or small as the region calls for. Holding these would give greater focus to regional developers and help to make DFs more 'open and accessible to all' in the spirit of the wider movement.

### From 2010 ###

#### Motion 10 (Part D) ####
DF committee should attempt to create and maintain a list of Kinsfolk contact details which keeps track of relevant and useful skills.  The list could be used to invite Young Kinsfolk to events in order to conduct skill sharing session and workshops and also to do volunteer work for DFs.  This already happens in a fairly ad-hoc way, but a list would formalize it.  A list may be problematic initially, but will ensure that more information is retained over a long period of time.  DFs should not seek to rely upon the skills of Young Kinsfolk, but rather facilitate the passing on of these skills to DFs.  Be creative with what a skill is, it could be anything from an expansive knowledge of climate science to being really good at running wide games.

#### Motion 13 ####
This DF Althing believes that motions are not always the most productive or inclusive way of
changing things within the movement. This DF Althing moves that Althing should provide a platform
at which problems and ideas can be discussed and solutions found in an open discussion. These
discussions should be focussed on coming up with positive actions to take forward. Further DFs will
bring a similar motion to Annual Gathering 2011 for all Woodcraft Folk.

##### Reason #####
This is going in the Democratic Procedures so this policy is unnecessary.

#### Motion 13 ####
This Althing recognises that support for young people working in groups is important for DFs and Woodcraft folk and therefore instructs the training rep to organise leadership training at least one DF social event per year.

##### Reason #####
While we have had leader training this year, it has not been part of a social event.

#### Motion 15 ####
This DF Althing instructs that Gift Aid be claimed on all eligible DF income to include donations made when attending events. The money raised through Gift Aid shall be considered restricted funding donated to the Koodoo Project for a national Woodcraft Folk campsite.

Motions to be kept for another year
-----------------------------------

This Althing does not repeal these motions, and as such they stand for another year.

### From 2008 ###

#### Motion 6 ####
This DF Althing instructs first aid training to take place at a social event each year. The organisation of this should be taken on by the training rep.

### From 2009 ###

#### Modified Motion 3 ####
This DF Althing realizes that the food served on DF events should be entirely inclusive. A vegan diet is healthy, cheap and, importantly, provides adequate nourishment for all DFs. Most importantly, a vegan diet has many environmental advantages (as fulfilling motion 11 of Althing 2009). KP’s should strive to provide food which is local to the camp, environmentally friendly, organic, from a cooperative source, fair trade and takes into account animal welfare. This means treating meat and other unethical foods as supplements rather than staples and allowing the possibility of meat free camps. Ultimately the decision is to be taken by KPs, who should endeavor to communicate their choices and actions to the wider movement.

#### Emergency Motion I ####
This DF Althing wishes to henceforth delegate the co-ordination of Span That World With Music to the events rep.

### From 2010 ###

#### Motion 2 ####
This Althing instructs all event coordinators to programme a 'Mini Thing' into all social event
programmes as an educational event in which all willing DFs are introduced to the process of DF
business and where any business relevant to social events is discussed and decisions are made.

#### Motion 3 ####
This DF Althing demands a National DF dress up day Span That World With Costume.

### From 2011 ###

#### Motion 1 ####
This DF Althing instructs that the DF symbol can only be used for and by DFs and not by the wider Woodcraft movement. This DF Althing recognises that the DF logo should not be used in place of the Woodcraft Logo, but can be used alongside it, or with credit to the DF Movement.

#### Motion 3 ####
This DF Althing instructs the incoming DF committee to create the 'Group Development Fund.' This fund shall be an unlimited resource from which individuals and groups of DFs can apply for money. The money can be used under the following restrictions:
    * The money must be used only to develop groups. In particular, new groups of Woodchips, Elfins, Pioneers and Venturers. 
    * The fund is unlimited BUT is left under the discretion of DF committee to safeguard the financial well-being of District Fellows. Applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

#### Motion 4 ####
This DF Althing instructs event to make a statement regarding consent, along with Drugs and Alcohol policy.

#### Motion 10 ####
This DF Althing proposes that people expensed to business events should have to pay for their food on events.
