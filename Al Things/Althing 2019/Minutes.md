## Musings
* **Volunteer Accountant**
  * External Volunteer
    * There is a basis of this
    * Maybe Internal Bookeeper
      * External Bookeeper allows continuity
      * Puts more pressure on Central woodcraft
        * Not necessarily well trained
      * Finance staff will be trained
      * **ACTION Treasurer Team & Saz&Maz: Contact central about how we should proceed with this issue**
  * Treasurer Training
    * Allows for Consistency within DFs without external involvement
    * Long term solution, maybe not best short term solution
    * Mandating Treasurer training will give Consistency but might not be necessarily
      * The turnover of training means that the Consistency slips with accounts
      * making guidelines for all future Treasurers/Shadows
        * You can't remember everything and we don't know that we haven't been taught stuff
          * Training every x number of years/ everytime someone thinks they need it
            * *Table Training discussion till we've had the training*
    * Does this make Shadow Treasurer unecersary
      * Shadow gives support to Treasurer
      * A day of training isn't nearly as good as a day of training and a year of experience
    * What sort of training
      * Community accountancy service training
        * Basic Bookeeeping, Basic budgeting and forcasting
        * In person
        * Free, so only expense for travel
      * **ACTION: Treasurer Team go to this training**
  * The current accounts are a mess
    * we should go through old payments
      * really difficult job
* **Web Fairy Weirdness**
  * Moving to Central website
    * Would be better for a DF run thing
    * Central Woodcraft website is a mess and worse than ours
    * We need to make sure that Central woodcraft has stuff advertising DFs on central website
  * There is a safeguarding issue if the web-fairy/comms decides to reset passwords and access google drives
  * We should move away from social media being a our main way of communications
    * Websites look better to external visitors and incoming members and their parents
  * WebFairy Team
    * Ex Dfs would be able to do stuff
      * Allows for sharing of skills
      * takes pressure of WebFairy
    * Training potential WebFairies
      * ASK HAZEL ABOUT TRAINING
    * **ACTION: WebFairy & Comms to make + Advertise the WebFairy team and set it up**
    * **ACTION: Joel & Hazel, find old web fairies and ask about training for Website stuff**
* **Shift Supply Satchels**
  * Make shift kits for on shift people
  * allows for people to be in contact and helps new Coordinator shifts
  * **List:**
    * What their shift is about
    * Note book
    * Walkie Talkies
      * are potentially difficult to use effectivly
      * Not as useful at smaller events
      * Maybe not everyone has a walkie Talkie
        * 3 would be good
      * not a huge expense (£22 for 4)
      * anything with batteries needs to be charged
      * allows people to be contactable with no signal
  * Need to consider what we are asking people to bring
  * **Safeguarding**
    * WalkieTalkies could be an issue
      * people can be trained how to use them
        * Safeguarding is especially important
      * WalkieTalkies bring too many other issues and mean more otherness to people on shift which removes the point of it
      * potential trail of the WalkieTalkies using Ash's
        * Allows us to get a wider view of what DFs think about it
        * we could use the fancy ones from V Camp
      * **Proposal: WalkieTalkies at Winter Wonderland**
        * **Action; Oliver, Izzy & WW Admin: Winter Wonderland WalkieTalkie Trail**
        * Used as a point of contact, not for conversations
          * Steward like, which isn't what our on-shift people are for
    * Notebooks
      * people writing lots of confidential stuff in Notebooks is bad
        * Proper training and screening for Mest-Up would help stop these issues from arising
      * Centralised Sign in/out book that isn't carried with them
        * Kind of redundant to have it centralised
    * **Action Beth: Organise Shift Kits**
