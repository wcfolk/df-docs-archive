  * Campaigns Rep is currently not filled
    * Previous proposal to change campaigns to activism
  * Motion has been written to change the Campaigns and Campaigns Rep
  * 2 Year Campaigns don't work in the current political climate
  * Activism could educate DFs on being better activists by running training and workshops at events
    * A Failing campaign can be demoralising and smaller projects can be run instead of a 2 Year Campaign
    * Helps raise awareness on Protests and other direct action
      * Helps become more recognised at protests and other direct action
  * Campaigns do give us a focus for our own actions
    * DFs don't need a campaign to give us our ideas
      * Campaigns could still allow us to collate our members into creating protests and other direct action
      * People don't tend to do stuff without being pushed to do it and the Campaign usually doesn't achieve a huge amount
      * DFs and potential Df Direct action are focused on London and wouldn't work well nationally
    * While DFs can mobilise as large groups but we are not good at organising it and it's very time consuming and difficult, especially when there are organisations that are much better at doing it. We would be better by supporting these groups
  * Protests could allow good photo oppurutinties
    * certain things we can't support or can only support in certain ways
  * We are very good at having people around the country but not organising them to come together

* Pricing
  * DFs need more money
  * We currently run 3 things, reducing it 2
    * making it a digital thing
      * things always run at a loss
        * A certain amount of event profits go into Thing funds
      * It is more difficult to do the thing stuff online
        * 5 people came to the last thing which is completely
    * Local things + Digital thing
    * Make things more fun
    * Not even have an online thing
      * Wasn't a plan to change the dates
    * We are struggling with money but aren't making a loss
    * Getting rid of the summer thing and making DF Camp mini thing bigger
      * Right after a thing is the most productive time for people
    * Discussion are not the only way to do buinesss
      * **Action: Lara Talk to to jack about fun businness stuff**
      * Open Space was very complained about
    * having a "Business" day at DF Camp
    * Make sure the absense of a thing doesn't effect the running on the social Events
      * Welsh thing didn't dicuss SA and it went fine
    * Having fun evening programme
    * "business" sounds bad
      * "Things" doesn't sound as bad
      * the word isn't as important as how you advertised
  * Raising Prices
    * We might need to raise prices so we don't go into reserves
      * reserves is the amount of money that we need to close as an organisation
    * Allowing Committee to raise event prices by Â£5 given a certain amount of time
    * We have had reducing numbers for a while
      * we have had a number of issues recuing our numbers and we hasn't done a huge amount to prevent that.
    * Budgets don't always work and shouldn't be the same between events
    * individual donations are a possibility
    * Late fees/early bird booking discounts
      * late fees are bad as they don't allow for people who don't know about people
* Reducing DF Camp length
  * reducing it to 5 days
    * potentially more people will come to DF Camp if it's shorter
  * We did it before and it worked
  * if there's a gap between the 2 it's less important
  * Promoting national/international events makes us look better
    * allows us to have a better interaction with wider woodcraft and districts
  * promoting a half week ticket
    * could make organising more difficult and the event less enjpoyable for the people who are staying for the entire event
