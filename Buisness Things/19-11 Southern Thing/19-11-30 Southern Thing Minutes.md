* Althing motion
  * at GC meeting they are going to make sure that half of people elected are
  female or non-binary
  * At DF we are better at having a balance of gender
  * We should write a motion for Althing that half of GC Reps are female or non-binary
  * Writing motion
    * _This Althing believes that gender should be a key focus within the DF Movement This includes representation of DFs Externally. It is also a current focus of the Woodcraft Folk, who want to have equal representation within their trustee board. For this reason, we propose that at any one time, at least 2 of the 4 DF Representatives on General Council will be of a minority gender (female or non-binary) at the time of election. This includes both committee and movement representatives._
    * _Rational: GC has a lot of male member on the board. we feel we should set an example for wider Woodcraft Folk by being equal._
